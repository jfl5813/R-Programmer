### STAT 480: Introduction to SAS Programming

STAT 480 is a class about SAS Programming, sort of like STAT 184 described above. STAT 480 meets once a week for an hour and is considered a 1-credit course. You can find from this [website](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/statconsulting/SAS) about what is SAS and why it is used. Here's a very good book for your reference.
